# Getting-and-cleaning-data-Project-Coursera

This repo hosts the final project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" (Coursera). You will find here the following files:

run_analysis.R the script designed to get and clean the data supplied in this link: run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

the script does the following:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

Tidy data set.txt the resulting file with the tidy data, created by launching run_analysis.R script.
